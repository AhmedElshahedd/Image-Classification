# Image Classification

This project is focused on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images into various categories. The model is implemented using PyTorch and supports image preprocessing, dataset loading, and training.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of images, where each image is labeled with a specific category. The model is designed to predict the category of a given image based on the patterns it has learned during training.
